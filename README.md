# MatAstra Website - Complete Beginner's Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you understand and edit the MatAstra website, even if you've never worked with websites before.

## üåü What This Website Is

This is a **landing page** for MatAstra - a company that makes software for monitoring power grids. The website:
- Shows visitors what the company does
- Explains the key features and benefits
- Provides contact information
- Is designed to look professional and modern

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used (Don't Worry - We'll Explain Everything!)

### 1. **Next.js** - The Foundation
Think of Next.js as the engine that powers the website. It's like the foundation of a house - you don't see it, but everything is built on top of it.

### 2. **React** - The Building Blocks  
React lets us build the website using components (like LEGO blocks). Each section of the website is a separate piece that we can modify independently.

### 3. **TypeScript** - Enhanced JavaScript
This is the programming language that makes the website interactive. The `.tsx` file extension means it's a TypeScript + React file.

### 4. **Tailwind CSS** - The Styling System
Instead of writing traditional CSS, we use Tailwind classes. Think of it like having pre-made style options:
- `text-xl` = extra large text
- `bg-blue-600` = blue background
- `p-4` = padding (space inside) of 16px
- `m-2` = margin (space outside) of 8px

## üìÅ File Structure

```
src/
  app/
    page.tsx          ‚Üê This is the main homepage file (the one we added comments to)
    layout.tsx        ‚Üê Overall page structure (header, footer, etc.)
    globals.css       ‚Üê Global styles that apply to the whole site
README.md             ‚Üê This file you're reading now!
```

## üé® Understanding the Website Layout

The website is divided into **sections**, like chapters in a book:

1. **Header/Navigation** - The top bar with logo and menu
2. **Hero Section** - The big banner with main message
3. **Technology Section** - Explains the technical features
4. **Features Section** - Lists key benefits
5. **Solutions Section** - Describes how it helps customers
6. **Statistics Section** - Shows impressive numbers
7. **Contact Section** - How to get in touch

Each section is wrapped in a `<section>` tag in the code.

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Make Common Edits

### Changing Text Content

**To change any text on the website:**

1. Find the text you want to change in `src/app/page.tsx`
2. Look for it between HTML tags like this:
   ```jsx
   <h1>Real-Time Power Grid Oscillation Monitoring</h1>
   <p>Innovative solutions for real-time PMU analysis...</p>
   ```
3. Simply replace the text between the tags
4. Save the file

**Example:** To change the main headline:
```jsx
// OLD:
<h1>Real-Time Power Grid Oscillation Monitoring</h1>

// NEW:
<h1>Advanced Power Grid Solutions</h1>
```

### Changing Colors

Colors in Tailwind follow this pattern: `color-intensity`

**Common colors:**
- `blue-600` (medium blue)
- `red-500` (medium red) 
- `green-400` (light green)
- `gray-800` (dark gray)
- `white` (white)

**To change a button color:**
```jsx
// OLD (blue button):
className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700"

// NEW (green button):
className="bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700"
```

### Changing Sizes and Spacing

**Text sizes:**
- `text-sm` = small
- `text-base` = normal  
- `text-lg` = large
- `text-xl` = extra large
- `text-2xl` = 2x extra large
- etc.

**Padding (space inside elements):**
- `p-2` = small padding
- `p-4` = medium padding
- `p-8` = large padding

**Margins (space outside elements):**
- `m-2` = small margin
- `m-4` = medium margin
- `m-8` = large margin

### Adding New Content

**To add a new feature in the Features section:**

1. Find the Features section (look for `{/* FEATURES SECTION */}`)
2. Copy one of the existing feature blocks:
   ```jsx
   <div className="flex gap-4 animate-fade-in-left">
     <div className="flex-shrink-0">
       <div className="flex h-10 w-10 items-center justify-center rounded-lg bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-950">
         <Clock className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400" />
       </div>
     </div>
     <div>
       <h3 className="mb-2 text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">Your New Feature Title</h3>
       <p className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
         Description of your new feature goes here.
       </p>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
3. Change the title and description
4. Change the icon (see Icons section below)

## üéØ Understanding Icons

Icons come from the **Lucide** library. At the top of the file, you'll see:
```jsx
import { Activity, AlertTriangle, Brain, ... } from "lucide-react";
```

**To use a different icon:**
1. Go to [lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev) to browse available icons
2. Add the icon name to the import statement
3. Use it like: `<NewIconName className="h-5 w-5" />`

**Example:**
```jsx
// Add to imports:
import { Star, Heart } from "lucide-react";

// Use in your code:
<Star className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-600" />
```

## üåô Dark Mode

The website automatically supports both light and dark themes! You'll see classes like:
- `text-slate-900 dark:text-white` = dark text in light mode, white text in dark mode
- `bg-white dark:bg-slate-900` = white background in light mode, dark background in dark mode

When adding new content, always include both light and dark versions.

## üì± Responsive Design (Mobile-Friendly)

The website adapts to different screen sizes using prefixes:
- `sm:` = small screens (phones)
- `md:` = medium screens (tablets)  
- `lg:` = large screens (laptops)
- `xl:` = extra large screens (desktops)

**Example:**
```jsx
className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl"
```
This means: large text on phones, extra-large on tablets, 2x extra-large on laptops+

## üé® Layout Concepts

### Flexbox (For Arranging Items)
- `flex` = arrange items in a row
- `flex-col` = arrange items in a column  
- `justify-center` = center items horizontally
- `items-center` = center items vertically
- `space-x-4` = add space between items horizontally
- `gap-4` = add space between all items

### Grid (For Complex Layouts)
- `grid` = create a grid layout
- `grid-cols-2` = 2 columns
- `md:grid-cols-3` = 3 columns on medium screens+
- `gap-8` = space between grid items

## üöÄ Making Your First Edit

Let's practice by changing the company tagline:

1. Open `src/app/page.tsx`
2. Find this line (around line 82):
   ```jsx
   Solving Real-World Power Grid Challenges
   ```
3. Change it to something else:
   ```jsx
   Your New Tagline Here
   ```
4. Save the file
5. The website will automatically update!

## üìû Updating Contact Information

**To change the email address:**
1. Find `href="mailto:info@matastra.com"`
2. Replace with your email: `href="mailto:youremail@company.com"`
3. Also update the button text: `info@matastra.com` ‚Üí `youremail@company.com`

**To change the phone number:**
1. Find `href="tel:608-588-6418"`
2. Replace with your number: `href="tel:555-123-4567"`
3. Also update the button text: `(608) 588-6418` ‚Üí `(555) 123-4567`

## üéØ Common Tasks

### Adding a New Section
1. Copy an existing section (everything from `<section>` to `</section>`)
2. Change the `id` attribute (e.g., `id="new-section"`)
3. Update the content inside
4. Add navigation link in the header

### Changing the Logo/Company Name
1. Find `MatAstra` in the header section
2. Replace with your company name
3. To change the lightning bolt icon, replace `<Zap>` with a different icon

### Updating Statistics
Find the Statistics section and change the numbers:
```jsx
<div className="text-4xl font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500">99.9%</div>
<p className="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">Uptime Reliability</p>
```

### Adding Animation
Most sections already have animations! Common ones:
- `animate-fade-in-up` = fades in from bottom
- `animate-fade-in-left` = slides in from left
- `animate-fade-in-right` = slides in from right
- `animation-delay-200` = starts animation 200ms later

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Website looks broken after editing?**
- Check that you didn't accidentally delete any `>`, `<`, or `"` characters
- Make sure every opening tag `<div>` has a closing tag `</div>`
- Undo your last change and try again

**Text not showing up?**
- Make sure the text is between HTML tags: `<p>Your text here</p>`
- Check that you didn't put text inside a `className` attribute

**Colors not working?**
- Use exact Tailwind color names: `bg-blue-600`, not `bg-lightblue`
- Don't forget the intensity number: `text-red-500`, not just `text-red`
